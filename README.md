# VizQ 
**Quantum Circuit Visualizer & Simulator**  

VizQ is a quantum circuit simulator that lets you build circuits with gates and visualize the output probabilities, statevector, and circuit diagrams.  

- **Frontend** → React (Vite, Recharts for visualization)  
- **Backend** → Python + Flask, powered by **Qiskit** for simulation  
- **Deployment** → Full stack hosted on **Render** (frontend + backend services)  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Add quantum gates (`H, X, Y, Z, RX, RZ, CX`) on chosen qubits.  
- View **circuit diagrams** generated by Qiskit.  
- Get **statevector results** in human-readable form.  
- Visualize **probability distributions** as bar charts.  
- Bloch vector support for single-qubit states.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. User selects **number of qubits** and adds gates in the React frontend.  
2. A request is sent to the **Flask backend** at `/simulate`.  
3. Backend uses **Qiskit** to:  
   - Build the quantum circuit.  
   - Simulate with `AerSimulator`.  
   - Return:  
     - Circuit image (base64 PNG).  
     - Statevector (complex amplitudes).  
     - Probabilities (from amplitudes).  
4. Frontend renders everything interactively.

## 🛠️ Development Setup  

### Install dependencies  
```bash
npm run install-py   # installs Python backend requirements
npm install          # installs frontend dependencies
Run in development mode
bash
Copy code
npm run dev   # runs React (Vite) + Flask backend together
```

Frontend → http://localhost:5173
Backend → http://127.0.0.1:5000/simulate

## 🚀 Deployment

* Frontend and backend deployed on **Render** as separate services.
* The frontend calls `https://vizq.onrender.com/simulate` in production.
* Render handles Python + Node environments out of the box.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Frontend** → React, Vite, Recharts
* **Backend** → Python, Flask, Qiskit, Numpy, Matplotlib
* **Deployment** → Render

## 📌 Notes for Developers

* Simulator uses **Qiskit’s AerSimulator**.
* Statevector is always returned; probabilities are derived as `|a|²`.
* Only basic gates supported for now (extendable).
* For production, swap Flask’s dev server with **Gunicorn/Uvicorn**.
